# DEVTOWN/SHAPEAI Front-End Web Development ESSENTIALS | JavaScript and React BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Bootcamp, conducted by <b> DevTown
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with DevTown.
